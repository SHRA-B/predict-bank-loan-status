## Project Overview

This project predicts whether a loan should be approved (`Y`) or not (`N`) based on applicant features such as income, credit history, loan amount, and more.

## Models Used

- Logistic Regression  
- Random Forest (with hyperparameter tuning via GridSearchCV)  

---

## Preprocessing Steps

- Handle missing values (median for numerical, mode for categorical)
- Encode categorical variables (label or one-hot encoding)
- Drop unnecessary features
- Feature scaling (for Logistic Regression)

---

## Evaluation Metrics

- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score
- ROC AUC Score
- Confusion Matrix & ROC Curve

## How to Run

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SHRA-B/predict-loan-status.git
   cd predict-loan-status
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Open and run all cells in** `Bank Loan Status.ipynb`.
4. **Output files:**  
   - Plots will save in the `Plot/` folder.
   - After running the prediction cell, results are saved as `loan_predictions.csv` in the main directory.

## Example: loan_predictions.csv

| Loan_ID   | Loan_Status |
|-----------|-------------|
| LP001015  | Y           |
| LP001022  | N           |
| ...       | ...         |
