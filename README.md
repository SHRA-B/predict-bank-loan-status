## Project Overview

This project predicts whether a loan should be approved (`Y`) or not (`N`) based on applicant features such as income, credit history, loan amount, and more.

## Models Used

- Logistic Regression  
- Random Forest (with hyperparameter tuning via GridSearchCV)  

---

## Preprocessing Steps

- Handle missing values (median for numerical, mode for categorical)
- Encode categorical variables (label or one-hot encoding)
- Drop unnecessary features
- Feature scaling (for Logistic Regression)

---

## Evaluation Metrics

- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score
- ROC AUC Score
- Confusion Matrix & ROC Curve

---

## How to Run

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SHRA-B/predict-loan-status.git
   cd predict-loan-status
2. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3.Open and run all cells in Bank Loan Status Prediction.ipynb.
4.Output files:

Plots will save in the Plot/ folder.

After running the prediction cell, results are saved as loan_predictions.csv in the main directory.

| Loan\_ID | Loan\_Status |
| -------- | ------------ |
| LP001015 | Y            |
| LP001022 | N            |
| ...      | ...          |
